\f0\fs26 \cf0 You: polish my words "Fires cause various and complicated types of damage and can truly ravage home or business in more ways than are immediately apparent. \
\
While fires can simply burn up belongings and parts of the structure, the intense temperatures can also cause a variety of swelling, buckling, and more. Also, the fire smoke from the fire damage can seep into your furniture, upholstery, drapes, wooden structural components and any other porous materials, and if it goes untreated the smell of smoke can linger for years.\
\
In this project, we would like to investigate the relationship between the estimated dollar loss and number of responding personnel in Toronto. The data `Fire Incidents` is obtained from the source `opendatatoronto` [@data]. Note that, the data is manipulated via package `dplyr` [@dplyr] and the table is lay out by `kable` in package `knitr` [@knitr]"\

\cf0 Chatgpt: "Fires unleash a spectrum of complex and intricate damages, often wreaking havoc on homes and businesses in ways that are not immediately visible. Beyond the obvious destruction of personal belongings and structural components, the intense heat from fires is capable of inducing a range of distortions, including swelling and buckling. Furthermore, smoke from fire damage insidiously infiltrates furniture, upholstery, drapes, wooden structural elements, and other porous materials. If left untreated, the pungent odor of smoke can stubbornly persist for years, embedding itself into the very fabric of the affected space.\
In this project, our aim is to explore the correlation between the estimated financial impact of fire incidents and the number of responding personnel in Toronto. The dataset 'Fire Incidents', sourced from opendatatoronto, serves as the foundation for our analysis [@data]. We have processed the data using the dplyr package [@dplyr], and the presentation of tables is refined using the kable function from the knitr package [@knitr]."\
